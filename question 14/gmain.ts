//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guest_list : string [] = ['Hamza' ,'Uzair','Hunain']; 
for(let i=0; i<guest_list.length; i++){
console.log('Respected Sir ' + guest_list[i] + ', \n invited you on dinner tomorrow ,\n\nThank you ' )}
